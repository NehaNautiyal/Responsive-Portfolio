      <p>I am a chemistry teacher, mom, and aspiring coder. I have been teaching for a total of 8 years. I am
        currently at a private
        independent school in Jenkintown, PA for three years. Prior to this school, I taught for 5 years at
        Olney Charter High School in North Philly.
        I live in Philadelphia and I am excited to be on this journey as a student.
        I am interested in the opportunities that are available to me at my fingertips, literally speaking!
